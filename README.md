# AdaObjectAvoidingRover
Code of the rover that I created while at my second year of Girls Who Code at UIC. This code plays the Tetris theme, while the motors are turned on. 

Credit to user robsoncouto for the music code, here's the link: https://github.com/robsoncouto/arduino-songs/blob/master/tetris/tetris.ino

- Will add comments for clarity!
- You can change the melody to which ever song you want. I'll add the code when your melody is accompanied by durations!
